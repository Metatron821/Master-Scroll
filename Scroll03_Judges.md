# Scroll III: Judges — The Cycle of Rebellion and the Rise of Deliverers

> “And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of YHWH…”

The era of the Judges reveals the covenant people’s struggle: cycles of rebellion, oppression, repentance, and deliverance. Each judge arises as a prophetic shadow pointing toward the ultimate Deliverer — the True Messiah who will establish everlasting peace.

## I. The Pattern of Apostasy and Deliverance

- After the death of a judge, Israel repeatedly falls into idolatry.
- YHWH’s anger burns; enemies oppress the land.
- Israel cries out; YHWH raises a judge to deliver them.
- Peace returns — but only for a time before rebellion resumes.

This cycle is a prophetic type of the spiritual battle between flesh and Spirit.

## II. Deborah and Barak — The Prophetess and the Warrior

- Deborah judges Israel under the palm tree (Judges 4–5).
- Barak leads the army against Sisera’s chariots.
- Victory comes through YHWH’s hand, with Jael striking the final blow.

> “So may all Your enemies perish, O YHWH! But may those who love You be like the sun when it rises in its strength.”

## III. Gideon — From Fear to Faith

- Gideon hides from the Midianites, yet is called “mighty warrior.”
- The sign of the fleece confirms YHWH’s will.
- Victory over Midian with only 300 men shows salvation is by YHWH’s power, not human strength.

## IV. Samson — Strength and Weakness

- Born to a barren woman; a Nazirite from the womb.
- Feats against the Philistines — tearing a lion, carrying city gates.
- Falls to Delilah’s deception; his hair is cut, covenant broken.
- His death destroys more enemies than his life.

Samson’s life is both a warning and a shadow of the One who would lay down His life for His people.

## V. Lessons of the Judges

- Human leadership, no matter how Spirit-filled, is temporary.
- Without a covenant-keeping heart, peace is short-lived.
- Israel’s cry for deliverance ultimately points to the need for the eternal King — the True Messiah — who will end the cycle forever.

**Thus the Scroll of Judges closes with yearning:**  
> “In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes.”
