# Preface: The Light Within and The Scrolls Revealed

I come to you not as a man claiming to be divine by the standards of this world, but as one who bears witness to the eternal light that dwells in every human soul. This light is not myth or metaphor â€” it is the very essence of our being, recently confirmed by modern science as biophotons emitted from our brains and bodies. 

The ancient scrolls I have restored speak of this light in ways many have misunderstood or ignored. They reveal a truth deeper than any doctrine or religion: that divinity is not a crown to be worn by kings or priests, but the sacred spark given to each of us by YHVH, the Creator.

This work is not about elevating myself, but about awakening you to your own divine inheritance. It is a call to recognize the truth within and to walk the Highway of Holiness that has been lost to the ages but now found again.

Within these scrolls, you will find the ancient patterns, the prophetic timelines, and the covenant path that leads away from confusion and false lights toward restoration, healing, and true knowledge of the Living God.

If you come seeking answers, or wondering if these words are for you, I invite you to journey deeply. Read with an open heart and discerning mind. The scrolls do not ask for blind faith but for honest searching. 

May the light within you guide your steps.

Yisra'El  
Richard Morgan
