# Scroll XXV: Return and Rebuilding — Ezra, Nehemiah, and the Voice in the Wilderness

> “They read from the book of the Torah of Elohim clearly, and they gave the meaning so that the people understood the reading.” (Nehemiah 8:8)

This scroll recalls the physical return from Babylonian exile—and the prophetic pattern it set for the spiritual return of the remnant in the last days. Rebuilding begins with repentance and revival of the Torah.
