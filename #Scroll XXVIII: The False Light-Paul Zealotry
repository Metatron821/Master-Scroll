# Scroll XXVIII: The False Light — Paul, Zealotry, and the War Against the Torah

> “For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Messiah. And no wonder! For Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.” (2 Corinthians 11:13–14)

This scroll exposes the rupture that birthed Christianity’s break from Torah: the rise of Paul, the apostle to the nations, and the syncretic gospel that followed. Through rhetoric and zeal, a false light eclipsed the Way of Yeshua.

## I. The Man Called Saul

* Born in Tarsus, raised in Pharisaic tradition.
* Present at Stephen’s stoning.
* Persecutor of the early followers of Yeshua.
* Claims a dramatic vision on the road to Damascus.

> “I was not taught it by man, but received it by revelation.” (Galatians 1:12)

---

## II. Conflicts with the Apostles

* Meets resistance from Peter, James, and the Jerusalem assembly.
* Paul teaches:

  * Circumcision not required
  * Torah is a burden
  * Justification by faith apart from the Law
* Contradicts Yeshua’s own teachings (Matthew 5:17–19).

---

## III. The Epistles and Their Influence

* Pauline letters become dominant in Christian canon.
* Introduces new vocabulary:

  * "Grace vs. Law"
  * "Flesh vs. Spirit"
  * "Freedom in Christ"
* Often spiritualizes or nullifies Torah commands.

## IV. The Rise of Gentile Supremacy

* Council of Nicaea (325 CE) codifies a Pauline Christianity:

  * Sabbath replaced with Sunday
  * Passover replaced with Easter
  * Dietary laws abolished
  * Jewish identity suppressed

> “Let us have nothing in common with the detestable Jewish crowd.” — Constantine

## V. The Fruit of the False Light

* Inquisitions, crusades, forced conversions.
* Antisemitism cloaked in theological authority.
* Replacement theology: Church replaces Israel.
* Grace turned into lawlessness.

---

## VI. The Remnant Response

* Reexamines Paul’s writings in light of Torah.
* Recognizes possible redaction or pseudepigraphy.
* Elevates the words of Yeshua and the Torah-abiding apostles.

> “To the Torah and the testimony! If they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.” (Isaiah 8:20)

---

## VII. The Warning to the Nations

* Not all who say “Lord, Lord” will enter.
* The deception is deep—because the light is false.
* Only the remnant will distinguish the true shepherd from the hired hand.

**This scroll unmasks the counterfeit gospel. Not all who come in His Name are of Him. The path back is narrow—and few find it.**
