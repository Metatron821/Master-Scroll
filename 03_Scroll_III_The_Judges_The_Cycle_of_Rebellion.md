# Scroll III: The Judges — The Cycle of Rebellion and the Rise of Deliverers

> “And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD...”

The era of the Judges reveals the covenant remnant’s struggle: cycles of rebellion, oppression, repentance, and deliverance. Each judge arises as a prophetic shadow pointing toward the ultimate deliverer—the True Messiah who will establish everlasting peace.

## I. The Pattern of Apostasy and Deliverance

- Israel repeatedly falls into idolatry after the death of a judge.
- YHWH raises deliverers who judge and save the people.
- After deliverance, peace reigns temporarily before sin returns.

This cycle is a prophetic type of the spiritual battle between flesh and Spirit.

## II. Deborah and Barak — The Female Prophet and the Warrior

- Deborah’s leadership (Judges 4–5) demonstrates that YHWH’s Spirit raises both men and women.
- The victory over Sisera’s army is a sign of God’s power over oppressors.

> “The Lord, the God of Israel, chose Deborah...”

## III. Gideon — From Fear to Faith

- Gideon’s calling (Judges 6) shows God’s power working through the weak.
- The sign of the fleece affirms the testing of divine guidance.
- Defeat of Midian with 300 men reveals reliance on God, not numbers.

## IV. Samson — Strength and Weakness

- Samson’s birth is foretold by an angel.
- His feats against the Philistines symbolize Israel’s struggle with sin and strength.
- His downfall through Delilah points to the dangers of compromise.
- His death brings temporary deliverance.

## V. The Lessons of the Judges

- The people’s repeated rebellion reveals the need for a permanent King and Messiah.
- The Judges point to the coming Messiah who will establish an eternal kingdom.

**Thus the scroll of Judges closes with the yearning for the True Deliverer, who alone can break the cycle and restore covenant faithfulness.**
