# Scroll IX: Return and Rebuilding — Ezra, Nehemiah, and the Voice in the Wilderness

> “Whoever is among you of all His people, may his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem...” (Ezra 1:3)

After seventy years of exile, YHWH stirs the heart of a pagan king, Cyrus of Persia, to fulfill the words spoken by Jeremiah. The remnant returns—not all at once, but in waves—to rebuild the temple, the walls, and the covenant identity.

---

## I. The Decree of Cyrus (Ezra 1)

* In the first year of King Cyrus of Persia, YHWH moves his heart to issue a decree:

> “Let the house of YHWH be rebuilt in Jerusalem.”

* Zerubbabel leads the first return, and with Joshua the high priest, lays the foundation.

---

## II. Opposition and Delay (Ezra 4–5)

* The work halts until the second year of Darius.
* Prophets **Haggai** and **Zechariah** exhort the people.

* Amid threats and ridicule, he rallies the people to restore the wall in 52 days.
* Workers carry trowels in one hand, swords in the other.

> “Remember the Lord, great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters...” (Nehemiah 4:14)

## V. Covenant Renewal (Nehemiah 8–10)

* Ezra reads the Torah aloud; the people weep.
* The Feast of Tabernacles is celebrated.

---

## VI. Malachi — The Last Voice Before Silence

* The final prophetic voice before the coming of the Messenger.
* Rebukes corrupt priests, faithless marriages, and neglect of tithes.
* Foretells the **coming of Elijah** before the Day of YHWH:

> “Behold, I send My messenger, and he will prepare the way before Me...” (Malachi 3:1)

---

## VII. The Pattern of Return

* The temple rebuilt = presence restored.
* The wall rebuilt = protection secured.
* The Torah re-read = covenant remembered.
