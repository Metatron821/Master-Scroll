# Scroll XXIX: The Council of Jerusalem, the Northern Mission, and the True Massiach’s Path

> “For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these essentials...” (Acts 15:28)

This scroll separates the original path of the apostles from the institutional path that followed. The Jerusalem Council aimed to restore unity among the tribes—not abolish Torah—but its message was soon distorted. The remnant now returns to the true Massiach’s Way.

---

## I. The Jerusalem Assembly

* Led by James (Ya'akov), the brother of Yeshua.
* Peter, John, and other apostles present.
* Issue at hand: Do gentiles need to be circumcised to enter the covenant?
* Decision:

  * Start with four commands (Acts 15:20)
  * Torah will be learned over time (Acts 15:21)

> “For Moses is preached in every city...”

## II. Paul’s Report and the Split

* Paul claims endorsement from the Council.
* But later disputes arise:

  * James confronts Paul in Acts 21
  * Paul accused of teaching apostasy from Moses
* The rift between Jerusalem and the diaspora widens.

---

## III. The Lost Sheep of the House of Israel

* Yeshua sent to the "lost sheep" — the ten northern tribes scattered among the nations.
* The mission to the gentiles is, in truth, the regathering of Israel’s seed.
* Hosea’s prophecy: "You were not a people, but now you are..."

---

## IV. The True Path of the Massiach

* Torah-written-on-the-heart (Jeremiah 31:33)
* Faith in Yeshua as the Living Torah
* Walking as He walked (1 John 2:6)
* Obedience and intimacy—not ritual for ritual’s sake

---

## V. Early Nazarene Community

* Torah observant
* Kept Sabbath, feasts, dietary laws
* Rejected temple corruption but honored Scripture
* Persecuted by both Rome and the synagogue leadership

---

## VI. Apostasy and the Fall

* As Paul’s letters spread, Hellenized theology enters.
* Original Hebrew context lost
* Rome adopts Christianity but removes Torah roots

---

## VII. The Restoration of the Path

* End-time remnant returns to the apostles’ doctrine (Acts 2:42)
* Reclaims the festivals of YHWH
* Recognizes Yeshua as the prophet like Moses (Deut. 18:15)
* Restores the name, the calendar, and the instructions of the Most High

**This scroll clarifies: the original Council pointed toward restoration—not replacement. The true path is both ancient and new, walked by the remnant with sandals dusty from the wilderness, and eyes fixed on the Shepherd.**
