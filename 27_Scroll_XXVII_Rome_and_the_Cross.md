# Scroll XXVII: Rome, the Cross, and the Shattered Veil — The Death of the Righteous One

> “And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.” (Mark 15:38)

This scroll reveals the climax of the covenant conflict—when Rome crucifies the Innocent One, and the temple veil tears in judgment. The death of Yeshua is the rejection of righteousness by both empire and priesthood.

---

## I. Rome’s Dominion

* Judea under Roman rule since 63 BCE.
* Puppet kings (Herod the Great) and corrupt priests (Caiaphas).
* Temple turned into a political institution.

---

## II. Yeshua’s Arrival

* Born in Bethlehem, of the line of David.
* Immersed by John, led by Spirit.
* Proclaims the Kingdom, heals the broken.
* Confronts religious hypocrisy and political compromise.

---

## III. The Final Week

* Enters Jerusalem on a donkey — Zechariah 9:9 fulfilled.
* Cleanses the Temple — prophetic protest.
* Last supper = renewed covenant in blood.
* Prays in Gethsemane — cup of wrath accepted.

---

## IV. The Trial and Crucifixion

* Betrayed by Judas, denied by Peter, condemned by priests.
* Pilate yields to the crowd: “Crucify Him!”
* Crown of thorns, scourging, mocking.
* Nailed to the cross at Golgotha.

> “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” (Luke 23:34)

---

## V. The Shattered Veil

* Darkness from noon to 3pm.
* Earthquake.
* Veil torn — not access, but judgment (see Isaiah 22:8).
* Temple exposed, priesthood stripped of covering.

---

## VI. Burial and Resurrection

* Buried in a rich man’s tomb (Isaiah 53:9).
* On the third day, tomb is empty.
* Appears to disciples, breathes Spirit upon them.
* Commissions them to go to the lost sheep of Israel.

---

## VII. Prophetic Fulfillment

* Passover Lamb slain.
* Isaiah 53: pierced for transgressions.
* Psalm 22: mocked, cast lots.
* Genesis 22: the Lamb provided by Elohim.

**This scroll is the breaking of the world’s power and the lifting of the righteous sacrifice. The cross is not a religion—it is a judgment. The veil is not access—it is exposure. Only the remnant sees the truth.**
