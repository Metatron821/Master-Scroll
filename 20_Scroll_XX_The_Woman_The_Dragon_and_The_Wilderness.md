# Scroll XX: The Two Witnesses — Fire, Olive Trees, and the Final Testimony

> “And I will grant authority to My two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.” (Revelation 11:3)

This scroll reveals the prophetic duel at the end of the age. As Babylon rises, so too do two anointed ones—like Moses and Elijah—who carry the Torah and Spirit before kings and nations. They are not merely two individuals, but also represent two bodies.

## I. Identity of the Two Witnesses

* Literal: two end-time prophets, in the spirit of Moses and Elijah.
* Symbolic: the Torah and the Prophets; the House of Judah and the House of Israel; the Word and the Spirit.
* Called “two olive trees” and “two lampstands” (Zechariah 4:3, Revelation 11:4).

---

## II. Their Mission

* Prophesy in sackcloth = repentance message.
* Call out the sins of nations and churches.
* Display power over nature:

  * Shut the skies (Elijah)
  * Turn water to blood (Moses)

> “If anyone wants to harm them, fire proceeds from their mouth...”

## III. The War Against the Witnesses

* The Beast from the abyss makes war on them.
* They are slain in the streets of the great city—spiritually called Sodom and Egypt.
* The world rejoices, sending gifts (mockery of Purim).

---

## IV. Resurrection and Ascension

* After 3½ days, breath of life enters them.
* A voice: “Come up here.”
* They ascend in a cloud—vindicated before all.
* A great earthquake follows.

---

## V. Historical Echoes

* Elijah vs. prophets of Baal.
* Moses before Pharaoh.
* Jeremiah and Isaiah rebuking kings.
* Yeshua: crucified in Jerusalem, raised in power.

---

## VI. Modern Fulfillment

* May emerge from the remnant community.
* Will be rejected by both church and state.
* Carry the original scrolls, Torah truth, and prophetic fire.

> “Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit...” (Zechariah 4:6)

**This scroll reminds us: in the darkest hour, the witness of YHWH does not falter. It burns, it bleeds, it ascends. The truth will testify—and the earth will tremble.**
