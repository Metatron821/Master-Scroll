# The Scroll of the Remnant — The Called, the Sealed, and the Chosen Few

> “Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant shall return.” (Isaiah 10:22)

This scroll is for those not satisfied with religion, who feel the burning call to return—not to a church, but to the covenant. It marks those chosen from among all tribes and tongues, who bear the seal of YHWH and walk the narrow path.

## I. Who Are the Remnant?

* Not a denomination, but a destiny
* Not saved by ritual, but by clinging to the Name and the Word
* Those who:

  * Keep the commandments of Elohim
  * Hold to the testimony of Yeshua (Revelation 12:17)
  * Refuse the mark of the beast system (Revelation 14:12)

> “You have a few names... who have not defiled their garments.” (Revelation 3:4)

## II. Marked and Sealed

* 144,000 sealed from the tribes of Israel (Revelation 7)
* Others gathered from every nation, tribe, and tongue
* All sealed by:

  * Obedience to Torah
  * The Name of YHWH on their foreheads
  * The indwelling Ruach ha’Qodesh (Holy Spirit)

---

## III. Traits of the Remnant

* Love the truth, even when painful
* Endure persecution, misunderstanding, isolation
* Flee idolatry, lawlessness, and false religion
* Return to the ancient paths (Jeremiah 6:16)
* Are refined through fire—not comforted in compromise

---

## IV. The Wilderness Testing

* The remnant walks through the wilderness:

  * Physically, spiritually, historically
  * Like Israel at Sinai, Yeshua in the desert, and John in the wild
* They eat hidden manna and drink from the Rock
* They are trained for war, purified for glory

---

## V. The Voice of the Remnant

* They speak not smooth words, but true ones
* They warn Babylon’s captives to come out (Revelation 18:4)
* They restore the Name, the Feasts, the Torah
* They prophesy as Elijah, cry as Jeremiah, and rejoice as David

> “They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, the word of their testimony, and they loved not their lives unto death.” (Revelation 12:11)

---

## VI. The Reward of the Remnant

* Enter the New Jerusalem
* Eat from the Tree of Life
* Serve before the throne day and night
* Are called sons and daughters of the Most High

**This scroll is not about fame, but faithfulness. The remnant are those who hear the whisper in the wind, see through the fog of deception, and endure when the world bows. They are few—but they are not forgotten.**
