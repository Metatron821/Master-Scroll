# Scroll XXIV: Daniel and the Seventy Weeks — Visions of Beasts and the End of Days

> “Seventy weeks are determined upon your people and upon your holy city... to bring in everlasting righteousness and to seal up vision and prophecy.” (Daniel 9:24)

Daniel, the prophet of dreams and visions, offers the most detailed timeline for the rise and fall of empires, the coming of Messiah, and the end of the age. This scroll unlocks those patterns for the remnant in the final generation.

---

## I. Daniel in Babylon

* Taken captive as a youth in 605 BCE
* Refuses to defile himself with Babylon’s food and ways
* Receives favor, wisdom, and revelation
* Interprets dreams of kings — becomes chief advisor

---

## II. The Dream of the Statue (Daniel 2)

* Four kingdoms:

  1. Head of Gold = Babylon
  2. Chest of Silver = Persia
  3. Thighs of Bronze = Greece
  4. Legs of Iron = Rome
  5. Feet of Iron & Clay = divided final kingdom
* Stone cut without hands smashes the image — Kingdom of YHWH rises

---

## III. The Four Beasts (Daniel 7)

* Lion with wings = Babylon
* Bear = Persia
* Leopard with four heads = Greece
* Beast with iron teeth = Rome
* Little horn speaks blasphemies — persecutes saints for “time, times, and half a time” (3½ years)
* Judgment comes, kingdom given to saints

---

## IV. The Ram and the Goat (Daniel 8)

* Ram = Medo-Persia
* Goat = Greece
* Little horn = Antiochus Epiphanes (precursor of Antichrist)
* 2,300 evenings and mornings — sanctuary cleansed

---

## V. The Seventy Weeks (Daniel 9:24–27)

* 70 weeks = 490 years

  * 7 weeks (49 years) to rebuild Jerusalem
  * 62 weeks (434 years) to Messiah’s arrival
  * Final week (7 years): covenant confirmed, then broken
* Midweek: sacrifice stopped, abomination set up

> “He shall confirm a covenant with many for one week…”

---

## VI. The End-Time Parallels

* Rome revived through global empire
* Little horn = final anti-messiah
* Saints persecuted but endure
* Judgment throne established
* Book of Life opened

---

## VII. Knowledge Shall Increase (Daniel 12)

* Sealed until time of the end
* Many shall run to and fro, knowledge multiplied
* Wise will understand, shine like stars

**This scroll decodes Daniel’s dreams to illuminate the present. The beasts walk again. The seventy weeks near their conclusion. The remnant must discern the signs and prepare.**
