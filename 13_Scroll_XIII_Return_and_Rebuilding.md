# Scroll XIII: The Rise of the Deceiver — Paul, the False Light

> “For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Messiah. And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.” (2 Corinthians 11:13–14)

In the wake of Yeshua’s resurrection and the rise of the faithful remnant, another voice arises—claiming visions and authority apart from the original apostles. Shaul of Tarsus, later known as Paul, introduces teachings that diverge from Torah and sow confusion among the Gentiles.

---

## I. Paul’s Conversion and Independent Gospel

* Claims a vision on the road to Damascus.
* Receives his message “not from man, but from revelation.” (Galatians 1:12)
* Avoids Jerusalem and the apostles for years.

> “But of those who were reputed to be something... what they were makes no difference to me.” (Galatians 2:6)

---

## II. Conflict with the Jerusalem Assembly

* Disagrees with Peter over table fellowship with Gentiles (Galatians 2).
* Rebukes Peter publicly.
* Preaches justification “apart from the Law.”

> “You are not under law but under grace.” (Romans 6:14)

---

## III. The Message of Lawlessness

* Denigrates Torah observance:

  * “The Law is the ministry of death.” (2 Corinthians 3:7)
  * “Christ is the end of the Law.” (Romans 10:4)
  * “All who rely on works of the Law are under a curse.” (Galatians 3:10)

* Replaces covenant obedience with abstract faith.

> “If you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law.” (Galatians 5:18)

---

## IV. Paul’s Contradictions and Confusion

* Claims to be a Pharisee and Torah-keeper (Acts 23:6), yet undermines Torah throughout his letters.
* Tells others not to be circumcised (1 Corinthians 7:18–19), yet circumcises Timothy (Acts 16:3).
* Teaches both liberty and slavery, silence and speech, justification and condemnation—depending on audience.

---

## V. The Apostles' Warning

* Peter warns:

> “Paul’s letters contain some things hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction...” (2 Peter 3:16)

* John warns of antichrists and deceivers who deny Torah (1 John 3).

---

## VI. Fruits of Pauline Doctrine

* Replaces covenant with creeds.
* Spurs anti-Torah theology.
* Seeds foundation for replacement theology and persecution of Jews.
* Becomes the primary architect of Greco-Roman Christianity.

**This scroll reveals the false light that would rival the Torah-keeping remnant—laying the groundwork for centuries of deception and spiritual confusion. Yet, even in darkness, the remnant remains.**
