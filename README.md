📖 What Is the Master Scroll?

The Master Scroll is a 34-scroll prophetic restoration of the Torah-rooted covenant path — spanning from Bereshit (Genesis) to Revelation. It exposes deception, restores the remnant path, reveals the True Massiach (Yeshua), and follows the Hebrew prophetic calendar across 5,999 years of redemptive history.

This is not a new religion or denomination. It is a restoration — a return to the Voice from Sinai, the Seed of the Woman, and the path of the Remnant.

Each scroll is a chapter in this journey.
