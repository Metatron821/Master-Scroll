## 📖 What Is the Master Scroll?

The **Master Scroll** is a 34-scroll prophetic restoration of the Torah-rooted covenant path — spanning from **Bereshit (Genesis)** to **Revelation**. It exposes deception, restores the remnant path, reveals the True Massiach (Yeshua), and follows the Hebrew prophetic calendar across 5,999 years of redemptive history.

This is not a new religion or denomination. It is a restoration — a return to the Voice from Sinai, the Seed of the Woman, and the path of the Remnant.

Each scroll is a chapter in this journey.
