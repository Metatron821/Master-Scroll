# Scroll XIV: The Church and the Empire — From Persecution to Power

> “They have transgressed the covenant, violated the Torah, and changed the ordinance.” (Isaiah 24:5)

After Paul’s teachings spread across the Roman world, the early assemblies that once clung to Torah slowly became infused with Greco-Roman philosophy and hierarchy. What began as a remnant movement of covenant faithfulness was co-opted by empire.

---

## I. The Persecuted Assembly

* 1st–3rd centuries: followers of Yeshua persecuted by Rome.
* Refused emperor worship.
* Torah-keeping assemblies operated underground.

---

## II. Constantine and the Christianization of Empire (312–325 CE)

* Constantine claims vision of a cross: “In this sign, conquer.”
* Legalizes Christianity (Edict of Milan, 313 CE).
* Calls the **Council of Nicaea** (325 CE):

  * Defines Yeshua as co-equal deity
  * Condemns Torah practices
  * Establishes **Sunday** as day of worship
  * Passover replaced by Easter

> “Let us have nothing in common with the detestable Jewish crowd.” — Council of Nicaea Record

---

## III. The Rise of Catholic Power

* Rome becomes center of authority.
* Bishops elevated above Scripture.
* Creeds replace the covenant.
* Images, saints, relics introduced — syncretism with paganism.

---

## IV. Doctrines Introduced by the Church

* **Original Sin** — Inherited guilt from Adam
* **Substitutionary Atonement** — Yeshua dies instead of us
* **Trinity** — God is three persons
* **Immaculate Conception** — Mary without sin
* **Confession to Priests** — Mediation apart from Messiah
* **Transubstantiation** — Bread becomes literal body of Christ
* **Purgatory** — Post-death purification
* **Sunday Worship** — In place of Sabbath

---

## V. Suppression of Torah and the Remnant

* Sabbath keepers hunted and accused of “Judaizing.”
* Jewish believers forced to renounce Torah to join the Church.
* Councils of Laodicea and others banned:

  * Observing festivals
  * Reading Torah in assemblies
  * Keeping the seventh-day Sabbath

---

## VI. The Hidden Remnant

* Small communities preserve Torah truth:

  * The Nazarenes
  * Ebionites
  * Later, the Sabbatarians and Anabaptists
* Often labeled heretics, burned, or scattered

---

**This scroll documents the transformation of the faith of Yeshua into a religion of empire, enforced by sword and law, while the true remnant fled into the wilderness.**
