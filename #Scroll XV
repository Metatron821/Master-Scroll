# Scroll XV: The Darkness and the Reformation — A Flicker in the Night

> “The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.” (John 1:5)

For over 1,000 years, the Roman Church dominated the religious landscape of Europe, enforcing its doctrines, rituals, and authority. But hidden in the shadows, the remnant preserved the truth of Torah and the testimony of Yeshua. In time, even among the captives of Rome, voices began to cry out.

---

## I. The Medieval Church (500–1500 CE)

* Latin Bible restricted to clergy.
* Common people barred from reading Scripture.
* Indulgences sold to reduce time in purgatory.
* Crusades, Inquisitions, and executions carried out "in the name of Christ."

---

## II. The Hidden Remnant

* Small sects resisted Roman authority:

  * **Waldensians**: preserved Scripture in local tongues.
  * **Anabaptists**: rejected infant baptism.
  * **Sabbath keepers**: clung to the 7th day.
  * **Bohemian Brethren**: emphasized Scripture and holy living.

> “They were burned with their books, but the Word lived on.”

---

## III. The Rise of Reformers (1500s)

* **Martin Luther** (1517): protests indulgences, posts 95 Theses.
* **John Calvin**: promotes predestination and sola Scriptura.
* **Zwingli, Knox, and others**: challenge Catholic supremacy.

---

## IV. The Printed Word

* Gutenberg Press (1450s) revolutionizes access to Scripture.
* Bibles translated into German, English, French, and more.
* The people begin reading Torah and Prophets for themselves.

---

## V. Partial Light, Partial Return

* Reformers rejected papal authority but retained many doctrines:

  * Sunday worship
  * Trinity
  * Replacement theology
  * Denial of Torah’s relevance

> “Christ is the end of the Law.” became their rallying cry.

---

## VI. Persecution of the Faithful

* Both Catholic and Protestant states persecuted Torah keepers.
* Sabbath keepers burned in Europe.
* Jewish believers still marginalized.

---

## VII. A Sign of Hope

* Despite error, the Reformation rekindled love for Scripture.
* Truth began emerging from centuries of darkness.

---

**This scroll bears witness to flickers of truth returning, yet warns that partial reform is not full restoration. The remnant still waits, scattered, hidden, yet alive.**
