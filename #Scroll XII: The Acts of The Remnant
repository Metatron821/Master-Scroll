# Scroll XII: The Acts of the Remnant — The True Followers and the Torah Path

> “But this I confess to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect, so I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things written in the Torah and the Prophets.” (Acts 24:14)

After the resurrection and ascension of Yeshua, the remnant of Israel—his disciples—begin to walk in the fullness of the renewed covenant. Empowered by the Spirit and rooted in Torah, they proclaim the good news first in Jerusalem, then to the nations.
