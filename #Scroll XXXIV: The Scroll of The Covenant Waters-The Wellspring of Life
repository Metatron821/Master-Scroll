“Behold, I make all things new.” (Revelation 21:5)

This scroll unveils the final hope and promise: the return to Eden’s fullness, the restoration of the Tree of Life, and the everlasting reign of YHWH’s Kingdom upon the renewed earth. It is the conclusion of the covenantal journey and the eternal dwelling of the faithful.

I. The New Heaven and New Earth
The former heaven and earth pass away, replaced by a perfect creation.

No more death, mourning, crying, or pain (Revelation 21:4).

The curse is removed forever; all is made new.

II. The New Jerusalem Descends
The holy city, radiant and pure, comes down from heaven.

Its foundations are adorned with precious stones symbolizing the tribes and apostles.

It has no temple because YHWH and the Lamb are its temple and light.

III. The Tree of Life Restored
Flows beside the river of life, yielding fruit every month.

Leaves bring healing to the nations, and the curse is no more.

Access to the tree is granted to the faithful, symbolizing eternal life and restored fellowship.

IV. The River of the Covenant
Water flows from the throne of Elohim and the Lamb, sustaining all life.

Represents the flow of divine Torah, wisdom, and life-giving Spirit.

The river connects all who walk in covenant and walk in the Spirit.

V. The Eternal Reign of the Remnant
The faithful reign with Messiah forever as sons and daughters of the Most High.

They serve before His throne, clothed in righteousness and glory.

The nations walk by the light of YHWH’s presence.

VI. The Final Blessing and Call
The Spirit and the Bride say, “Come!”

The promise of the new Eden is open to all who thirst and seek.

The scroll ends with an invitation to enter into eternal covenant and rest.

This scroll concludes the prophetic journey. From the Garden lost to the Garden restored, from exile to eternal fellowship, the covenant is fulfilled, and the remnant inherit the Kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world.
