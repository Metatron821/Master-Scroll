# Scroll XIX: The Beast and the Mark — Systems of Control and the Great Deception

> “And I saw a beast rising out of the sea... and the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority.” (Revelation 13:1–2)

This scroll unveils the rise of global systems—religious, political, and economic—that war against the remnant. The Beast is not a single man, but a conglomerate: a spiritual empire built on deception, control, and rebellion against the covenant.

---

## I. The Beast of the Sea — The Political Power

* Multinational rule likened to lion, bear, and leopard (Daniel 7).
* Seven heads = seven empires (Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome, revived Rome).
* Ten horns = globalized authority (UN, NATO, financial elite).

> “Who is like the beast, and who can wage war against it?”

---

## II. The Beast of the Earth — The False Prophet

* Looks like a lamb (Messiah-like), speaks like a dragon.
* Performs signs, deceives the world.
* Represents religious syncretism—ecumenical false unity.
* Promotes image of the first beast.

---

## III. The Mark of the Beast — The System of Allegiance

> “He causes all... to receive a mark on their right hand or forehead.” (Revelation 13:16)

* Not merely physical—spiritual allegiance.
* Forehead = belief; hand = actions.
* Mirrors Torah’s sign and frontlets (Deuteronomy 6:8).

> “Bind them as a sign on your hand and as frontlets between your eyes...”

* The Beast’s mark is the anti-Torah: lawlessness.
* Enforced through technology, economy, and fear.

---

## IV. Babylon the Great — The Mother of Abominations

* Revived spiritual Babel.
* A mixture of all religions—tolerance over truth.
* Rome, Mecca, and the World Council of Churches blend into a false unity.

---

## V. The Image and the System

* Image speaks—AI, surveillance, media.
* No one buys or sells unless marked.
* Digital currency and biometric ID systems emerge globally.

---

## VI. The Remnant’s Response

* Refuse the mark—both in belief and action.
* Cling to the commandments of YHWH and the faith of Yeshua.
* Endure persecution, exclusion, and exile.

---

> “Here is the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Yeshua.” (Revelation 14:12)

**This scroll exposes the Beast as the culmination of centuries of rebellion—religious deception, state oppression, and economic coercion. But the faithful will overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony.**
