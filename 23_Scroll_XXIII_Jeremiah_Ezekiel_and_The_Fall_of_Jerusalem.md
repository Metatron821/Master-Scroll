# Scroll XXIII: Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Fall of Jerusalem — Echoes in the Last Days

> “I have set you as a watchman... when you see the sword coming, blow the shofar and warn the people.” (Ezekiel 33:7)

This scroll returns to the time of the exile prophets, whose words serve both as historical witness and future pattern. The fall of Jerusalem under Babylon mirrors the judgment on the end-time Babylon and prepares the pattern of restoration.

## I. Jeremiah — The Weeping Prophet

* Called from the womb to uproot and to plant.
* Warned Judah of coming Babylonian siege.
* Preached repentance, but was ignored.
* Wrote of a **new covenant**:

  > “I will put My Torah in their hearts...” (Jeremiah 31:33)

---

## II. Ezekiel — The Visionary of Exile

* Prophesied among exiles by the river Chebar.
* Saw throne above the firmament — the Kavod (glory).
* Dry bones vision:

  * House of Israel restored from death to life
  * Two sticks (Judah & Ephraim) become one

---

## III. The Fall of Jerusalem (586 BCE)

* Temple destroyed by Babylon
* Ark hidden or lost
* People exiled for violating Sabbaths, shedding innocent blood, idolatry

> “Because they have forsaken My Torah and walked after Baals...” (Jeremiah 9:13–14)

---

## IV. Prophetic Echoes for the End

* Jerusalem again surrounded by enemies
* False prophets proclaim peace
* True prophets weep and warn
* Many remain in denial—trusting in false security

---

## V. Patterns of Judgment and Hope

* Siege → Exile → Remnant → Return
* Torah-breaking leads to captivity
* Repentance leads to restoration

> “The soul that sins shall die... but if he turns from his wickedness, he shall surely live.” (Ezekiel 18:4, 21)

---

## VI. Covenant Restoration in the Latter Days

* Jeremiah’s scrolls rediscovered
* Ezekiel’s Temple vision inspires the final blueprint
* Prophets reawaken in the children of the remnant
* The Spirit breathes again on the dry bones

---

**This scroll is both history and warning. It shows that when the covenant is forsaken, destruction follows—but when hearts turn again to Torah, the exile ends.**
