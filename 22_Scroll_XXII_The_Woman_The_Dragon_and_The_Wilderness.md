# Scroll XXII: The Woman, the Dragon, and the Wilderness — Israel and the War in Heaven

> “And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun... and the dragon stood before the woman... to devour her child as soon as it was born.” (Revelation 12:1–4)

This scroll reveals the cosmic conflict behind earthly events—the war for the seed, the woman, and the covenant. The woman is not the church, but Israel; the dragon is not mythology, but the ancient adversary of YHWH’s promises.

## I. The Woman Clothed with the Sun

* Symbolizes Israel:

  * Sun = Jacob (Genesis 37:9)
  * Moon = Rachel (matriarchs)
  * 12 stars = tribes of Israel
* Gives birth to a male child (Yeshua, the Torah-made-flesh)
* Child is caught up to Elohim (Ascension)

---

## II. The Dragon’s Pursuit

* Dragon = haSatan (the adversary)
* Seeks to devour the child — genocide, Herod, crucifixion
* Fails — child is preserved
* Turns wrath against the woman — persecutes Israel

---

## III. War in Heaven

* Michael and his angels fight against the dragon
* Dragon cast down to earth

> “Woe to the earth... for the devil has come down to you with great fury.”

---

## IV. The Woman Flees to the Wilderness

* Wilderness = exile, protection, and purification
* 1,260 days (3.5 years or symbolic eras)
* Nourished by YHWH — like Israel in Sinai

---

## V. The Remnant of Her Seed

> “Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to make war with the rest of her offspring—those who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Yeshua.” (Revelation 12:17)

* Remnant = Torah-keepers and Yeshua-followers
* The true Israel of Elohim
* Scattered in all nations, awakening in the last days

---

## VI. The Earth Helps the Woman

* Swallows the flood sent by the serpent
* Natural disasters, empires collapse, exposing lies
* The earth prepares for the return of the Seed

---

**This scroll reminds the faithful of their identity—not as orphans of religion, but as children of the woman, born of covenant, protected by prophecy, and destined to overcome the dragon by blood and testimony.**
