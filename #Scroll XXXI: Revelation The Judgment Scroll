# Scroll XXXI: Revelation, the Judgment Scroll, and the World to Come

> “Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth... and I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from Elohim, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.” (Revelation 21:1–2)

This scroll unveils the final seal—the unveiling of the Lamb’s reign, the judgment of the wicked, and the reward of the faithful. What was hidden from the foundation of the world is now revealed: the wedding, the kingdom, and the restoration of all things.
