# Scroll XXI: Trumpets and Wrath — The Judgment Unleashed

> “The seventh angel sounded, and there were loud voices in heaven, saying: ‘The kingdoms of this world have become the kingdom of our Master and of His Messiah.’” (Revelation 11:15)

This scroll reveals the pattern of warning and judgment poured out upon the earth. The shofars sound, echoing Sinai and Jericho—calling both repentance and collapse. The plagues mirror Egypt, but this time on a global scale.

---

## I. The Pattern of Sevens

* **7 Seals**: unveil the scroll of destiny
* **7 Trumpets**: warn the earth
* **7 Bowls**: release wrath

---

## II. The Trumpets Sound (Revelation 8–11)

1. Hail and fire mixed with blood
2. Burning mountain into the sea
3. Star named Wormwood poisons waters
4. Sun, moon, stars darkened
5. Abyss opened—locust torment
6. 200 million horsemen
7. Kingdom declared to belong to Messiah

---

## III. Egypt Echoed

* Water to blood, darkness, boils, hail, locusts—plagues return.
* But now it is spiritual Egypt (Revelation 11:8).
* Pharaoh hardened his heart—will the nations do the same?

---

## IV. The Bowls of Wrath (Revelation 16)

1. Painful sores on the marked
2. Sea turns to blood
3. Rivers become blood
4. Sun scorches with fire
5. Darkness on the beast’s throne
6. Euphrates dried—armies gather
7. Great earthquake, Babylon falls

---

## V. The Remnant Sealed

* 144,000 sealed from the tribes of Israel.
* Those not sealed suffer plagues.
* Like Goshen in Egypt, the faithful are protected.

> “Come, My people, enter your chambers... until the indignation is past.” (Isaiah 26:20)

---

## VI. The Fall of Babylon

* Global system collapses in one hour.
* Merchants weep, kings mourn.
* The souls of men were her merchandise.
* Heaven rejoices at her fall.

**This scroll reveals that judgment is not chaos—it is justice. The trumpets are not noise—they are alarm. The wrath of YHWH is not rage—it is the final call to return before the doors shut.**
