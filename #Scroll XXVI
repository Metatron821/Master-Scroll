# Scroll XXVI: The Maccabees, the Abomination, and the Cleansing of the Temple

> “Then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.” (Daniel 8:14)

This scroll recounts the prophetic events between the testaments, when the seed of rebellion rose in the form of Antiochus Epiphanes—and the faithful few resisted. The Maccabees preserved the covenant, and Hanukkah became the pattern of dedication amid defilement.

* Temple desecration will return.
* Remnant must cleanse their hearts and assemblies.

**This scroll is the story of defiance and purity. The fire on the altar must never go out. The remnant must be as the Maccabees—fewer in number, but fierce in faith.**
