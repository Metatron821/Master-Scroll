# Scroll XVIII: Covenant Waters and the Well of the Oath — Origins and Return

> “He called that place Be'er-Sheva, because the two of them swore an oath there.” (Genesis 21:31)

This scroll plunges into the mystery of the sacred center—Be’er-Sheva, the Well of the Oath. It marks not only the covenant with Abraham, but becomes the prophetic source of return, fire, and redemption. All rivers lead back to the well.

## I. The Oath of Abraham

* Abraham makes a treaty with Abimelech.
* Seven lambs given as witness—"Be’er Sheva” means "Well of the Seven" or "Well of the Oath."
* Becomes a recurring place of encounter:

  * Jacob dreams near Be’er Sheva before exile to Egypt.

## II. The Pre-Pangaea Model

* All lands once gathered near the well.
* Waters flowed outward from the center (Genesis 2:10).
* The division of continents came after the flood—judgment split the unity.

> “He set the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the sons of Israel.” (Deuteronomy 32:8)

* Sinai: fire on the mountain and water from the rock.

## V. The Re-Digging of the Well

* The remnant returns to the origin.
* Ancient paths restored.
* The well becomes the epicenter of final covenant renewal.

> “Spring up, O well! Sing to it!” (Numbers 21:17)

**This scroll calls all tribes and tongues back to the center—to the place of the oath, where water meets fire, and the scattered return to drink.**
